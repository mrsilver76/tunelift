# TuneLift
_A Windows command line tool to export iTunes audio playlists as standard or extended `.m3u` files. It can also adjust file paths for compatibility with other computers, operating systems (like Linux), NAS devices and embedded systems._

>[!TIP]
>Using Plex for music? [ListPorter](https://github.com/mrsilver76/listporter) makes it easy to import your resulting `.m3u` files to Plex Media Server.

## üß∞ Features
* üîó Connects directly to iTunes via the exposed COM interface, rather than parsing XML files.
* üíæ Export playlists in basic or extended M3U formats.
* üß† Export only smart (dynamic rule-based) playlists, regular (manual) playlists or all playlists.
* üö´ Exclude exporting any playlist whose name starts with specified text.
* üêß Convert paths (forward slashes and LF endings) for Linux.
* üîÅ Rewrite paths to make exported playlists portable.
* üìÅ Remove a common base path from file entries to make playlists relative.
* üßπ Delete existing exports before saving new ones.
* ‚èπÔ∏è Automatically close iTunes after export if TuneLift started it.

## üì¶ Download

Get the latest version from https://github.com/mrsilver76/tunelift/releases. If you don't want the source code then you should download the exe file. 

You may need to install the [.NET 8.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime) first. 

This program has been tested extensively on Windows 11, but should also work on Windows 10.

## üöÄ Quick start guide

Below are a couple of command scenarios for using TuneLift:

```
TuneLift.exe /d "c:\temp\playlists" -c

TuneLift.exe --delete "c:\temp\playlists" --close
```
* Export all playlists from iTunes and save them into `C:\Temp\Playlists`.
* Delete any playlists already in the folder before starting.
* Close iTunes after exporting (if it was started by TuneLift)

```
TuneLift.exe "C:\Users\MrSilver\Documents\Playlists" -ne -i "run" -ns

TuneLift.exe "C:\Users\MrSilver\Documents\Playlists" --not-extended --ignore "run" --no-smart
```
* Export all playlists from iTunes and save them into the `My Documents\Playlists` folder owned by `MrSilver`.
* Use the basic (not extended) `m3u` file format.
* Don't export any playlists with a title that starts with `run`.
* Don't export smart (dynamic rule-based) playlists.

```
TuneLift.exe \\raspberry\pi\playlists -d -l -f "C:/Users/MrSilver/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music" -r "/home/pi/music"

TuneLift.exe \\raspberry\pi\playlists --delete --unix --find "C:/Users/MrSilver/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music" --replace "/home/pi/music"
```
* Export all playlists from iTunes and save them into the shared network folder `\\raspberry\pi\playlists`.
* Delete any playlists already in the folder before starting.
* Write the playlist files with Unix paths and file endings.
* Replace `C:\Users\MrSilver\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Music` with `/home/pi/music`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using `--unix`, path slashes are converted before any `--find` and `--replace` operations. Make sure your `--find` string reflects the adjusted slash style. In the example above, backslashes are converted to `/`, so `--find` must also use forward slashes (`/`.

## üíª Command line options

```
TuneLift.exe [options] <destination folder>
```

If `<destination folder>` doesn't exist then it will be created.

`[options]` can be 1 or more of the following:

### Playlist selection

- **`/ns`, `-ns`, `--no-smart`**  
  Skips smart (dynamic rule-based) playlists and exports only regular (manual) ones.

- **`/np`, `-np`, `--no-playlist`**  
  Skips regular (manual) playlists and only exports smart (dynamic rule-based) playlists.

- **`/i <text>`, `-i <text>`, `--ignore <text>`**  
  Excludes playlists whose names start with `<text>`. This is case-insensitive, so `--ignore temp` will ignore playlists with titles such as "TEMPMIX" and "Temp - Chill".

### Output format

- **`/8`, `-8`, `--append-8`**  
  Exports playlists with the `.m3u8` extension instead of `.m3u`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Playlist files are always encoded in UTF-8.** This ensures broad compatibility with file paths and file names that contain non-ASCII characters (eg. accented letters, umlauts or non-Latin symbols). The `--append-8` flag simply changes the extension to `.m3u8`.

- **`/ne`, `-ne`, `--not-extended`**  
  Outputs basic `.m3u` files without extended metadata (track duration or title). This is useful when trying to use the playlists with simpler or legacy media players.

- **`/u`, `-u`, `--unix`**  
  Converts Windows-style paths (backslashes) to Unix-style (forward slashes) and uses LF line endings. This is useful when exporting playlist files that will be used on Unix based machines - such as NASes, media servers or embedded systems.

> [!TIP]
> If you plan to use `--unix` then you may need to manipulate the path so that it correctly points to the songs. See [Path rewriting](#path-rewriting).

### Path rewriting

If the playlist will be used by other users, machines, or software, the original file paths may not work for them. For example, a path like `D:\MyMusic` might not be accessible from a NAS or another computer. Even if the files are shared, the other system may require a different path, such as `\\mycomputer\MyMusic`. To address this, you can use the options below to rewrite paths so they match the environment where the playlist will be used:

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [ListPorter](https://github.com/mrsilver76/listporter) to upload your playlists to Plex, you probably don't need to rewrite paths! This is because ListPorter uses fuzzy matching to associate tracks, even when the paths don‚Äôt match exactly.

- **`/f <text>`,`-f <text>`, `--find <text>`**  
  Searches for a specific substring in each file path. This is intended for use with `--replace` to modify paths for different devices or OSes. Searches are case-insensitive and you can only find one substring.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When also using `--unix`, backslashes in the path will be replaced with forward slashes **before the search and replace is performed**. As a result, searches containing `\` will always fail unless they are manually replaced with `/`.

- **`/r <text>`, `-r <text>`, `--replace <text>`**  
  Replaces matched text from `--find` with this new value. If `--find` is used and there is no `--replace` value, then it will be assumed to be blank and the matching string will be removed.

- **`/b <path>`, `-b <path>`, `--base-path <path>`**   
  Removes the specified base path from the beginning of each file path in the exported playlist. This is useful when you want the playlist entries to be relative to a certain directory. The comparison is case-insensitive.

  If your music files are located at `C:\Music\Library\Artist\Song.mp3` and you set `--base-path C:\Music\Library\`, the resulting path in the playlist will be `Artist\Song.mp3`.

> [!NOTE]
> The base path is removed before any other rewriting actions (such as `--find`, `--replace`, or `--unix`) are applied.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid leaving a leading slash or backslash in the result, make sure your `--base-path` ends with the appropriate path separator (`\` for Windows-style paths or `/` for Linux-style paths).

### File management

- **`/d`, `-d`, `--delete`**  
  Deletes playlist files already in the destination folder before exporting new ones.

### Other options

- **`-c`, `--close`**  
  Automatically closes iTunes after the export completes, but only if TuneLift started it. iTunes will not be closed if it was already running beforehand.

- **`-nc`, `--no-check`**  
  Disables GitHub version checks for TuneLift.

>[!NOTE]
>Version checks occur at most once every 7 days. TuneLift connects only to [this URL](https://api.github.com/repos/mrsilver76/tunelift/releases/latest) to retrieve version information. No data about you or your music library is shared with the author or GitHub - you can verify this yourself by reviewing `GitHubVersionChecker.cs`

- **`/?`, `-h`, `--help`**  
  Displays the full help text with all available options, credits and the location of the log files.
